# AI/ML-Driven Pokedex

Welcome to the AI/ML-Powered Pokedex! 
This project leverages machine learning, automation, and modern backend architecture to create an intelligent system that analyzes Pok√©mon images and generates detailed entries. 
It also includes a recommendation engine for personalized Pok√©mon suggestions.

## üåü **Project Highlights**

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes OpenAI Vision to analyze Pok√©mon image URLs submitted by users.
- **Dynamic Text Generation**: Employs OpenAI's text generation capabilities to create unique Pokedex entries.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggests Pok√©mon based on user inputs using collaborative filtering or content-based algorithms.
- **Backend Automation**: Built using Python and Tines, ensuring scalable and interactive performance.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Hosted on AWS Lambda for seamless and cost-effective scaling and AWS Elastic Container Registry to containerise the ML model and it's requirements

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

- **Open Source AI**: 
  - OpenAI Vision for image analysis.
  - OpenAI textgen for generative text.
- **Backend**:
  - Python for data preprocessing and model training.
  - Tines for automation workflows and record management.
- **Frontend**:
  - Tines Pages were used to create an interactive frontend for the user to interact with the various APIs.
- **Cloud Hosting**:
  - AWS Lambda for deploying the recommendation engine.
  - AWS ECR for packaging model.
- **Data Management**:
  - Tines Records for storing user-submitted Pok√©mon data, acting as database.

## üîç **Features**

1. **Image Analysis**:
   - Upload a Pok√©mon image URL to receive a detailed Pokedex entry.
   - Example: Submit an image of Pikachu, and the system generates an entry with its description, abilities, and type.
      

2. **Personalized Recommendations**:
   - Based on your inputs (e.g., favorite type, strengths), receive tailored Pok√©mon suggestions.
   - Example: "If you like Fire-type Pok√©mon, you might also enjoy 'Arcanine'!"
   - Example: "If you would like to add a strong Pok√©mon, catch a 'Mewtwo'!"
     - The data was taken from open source APIs and taught to the ML model. 
     
3. **Interactive Backend**:
   - User-friendly workflows powered by Tines ensure seamless data submission and retrieval.
